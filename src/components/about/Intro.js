        I recently graduated from University of Washington Full Stack Web
        Development bootcamp, where I learned the the core competency in full
        stack web development such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL and the MERN
        stack. I have worked on frontend, backend, and full stack projects in a
        collaborative environment. I have taken on and completed a volunteer
        project of building a screen capture web app that aids an automotive
        Search Engine Optimization company on their general website maintenance
        since I completed the bootcamp.

        I enjoy working around people with different background and with
        different culture. I grew up in a multicultural environment and have
        learnt to respect and appreciate value different people bring together
        with the background.{" "}
